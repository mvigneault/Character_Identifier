Here are our PBIs:

As a user I see the character displayed in a large font so that I can see it clearly. 

As a user I can paste a character into the app so that I can find out the unicode.

As a user, I can be shown how my character is code in java so I can use it in my own code. 

As a user, I can learn what the character means so I know how to use it properly.

As a user I can see the unicode/hex/decimal so that I can generate the character in other languages.

As a user I can see how the character look like, so that I can choose if I want to use it or not.
